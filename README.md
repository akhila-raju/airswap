AirSwap Back End Engineer Exercise

Prompt:
"We were hoping youâ€™d be able to put together a quick command line-based service that does the following:

1. Takes an argument for a pair of crypto currencies like ETH/BTC (Ethereum and Bitcoin) 
2. Connects to the Poloniex exchange (https://poloniex.com) 
3. Calculates a 1-minute simple moving average of price for the provided token pair on an ongoing basis 
4. Displays the value in the shell while the program is running

We are interested in the completeness of the exercise and your coding style. Based on your particular skill set, consider adding any of the following features (or expand on the core requirements with your own flair):

Stores state in a scalable manner
Handles additional third party data streams, including errors and unavailable data streams
Is coded entirely in a functional style where all variables are immutable
Contains 90% or more test coverage, including edge case tests"
